## Description

The following project contains an Infrastructure as Code deployment
of a popular Ghost Content Management System using terraform

The deployment will be on Digital Ocean Droplet using a specific domain
and creating a DNS record.

Terraform as Infrastructure as Code tool can be used on many cloud providers
but in this case for simplicity and cost we choose to work with Digital Ocean,
but the provider and cloud specific modules can be replaced as needed for other provider
